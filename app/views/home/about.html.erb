      <h3>About RxMAGIC</h3>

      <p class="text-justify font-weight-light mt-2 mb-4">
        Free clinic dispensaries face immeasurable challenges due to a complex, diverse, and medically vulnerable patient population
        in addition to a limited medication formulary. Our goal is to help pharmacists effectively and efficiently manage their resources
        while providing quality pharmaceutical services. By improving management tools and reducing duplicate efforts, we believe an information
        system at the dispensary level will mitigate workflow challenges, improve provider communication, and enhance the process of medication
        management. Therefore, we created a system for Prescription Management and General Inventory Control (RxMAGIC) as an open source software
        platform that is designed to facilitate dispensary workflow and improve medication and inventory management.
